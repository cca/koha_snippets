        If we had a CCA email on file for you, we were able to associate it with your library account. However, several accounts did not have CCA emails. <strong>If you have used the library previously but are unable to login with your CCA username, please <a href="https://libraries.cca.edu/contact">contact us</a> so we can fix this.</strong>

        <li>Visiting researcher sponsored by a CCA affiliate</li>
        <li>Alumnus who graduated over ten years ago</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If you fall into one of the above categories, please use the form below. Your login is of form "surname.givenname" (e.g. "jones.olivia" for someone named "Olivia Jones") and your password is your library barcode (should look something like "PCAC9876543210X"). As always, <a href="https://libraries.cca.edu/contact">contact us</a> if you experience any problems.
