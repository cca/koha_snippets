        Some library users do not have CCA accounts. You might not have a library account if you are a:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Special program faculty member who does not regularly teach at CCA</li>
        <li>Visiting researcher sponsored by a CCA affiliate</li>
        <li>Alumnus who graduated over ten years ago</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If you fall into one of these categories, use the login form below. Your username is of form "surname.givenname" (e.g. "jones.olivia" for someone named "Olivia Jones") and your password is initially set to be your library barcode (something like <code>PCAC9876543210X</code>) but can be changed. Please <a href="https://libraries.cca.edu/contact">contact us</a> if you experience any problems.
    </p>

    initially & then, once other form has been removed, uncomment with JS -->
