<h2>Trouble logging in?</h2>
<p style="margin-top:1em;">Some library users do not have CCA accounts:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Alumni whose CCA accounts have expired</li>
    <li>Pre-college students</li>
    <li>Visiting researchers sponsored by a CCA affiliate</li>
</ul>
<p>
    If you fall in one of these categories, use the form above. Your username is <code>surname.givenname</code> (e.g. "jones.olivia" for someone named "Olivia Jones") and your password was initially set to your library barcode (something like <code>PCAC9876543210X</code>) but can be changed. <a href="https://libraries.cca.edu/about-us/about-us/ask-a-librarian/">Contact us</a> if you experience any problems.
