        We tried to match your library account with your CCA username, but in some instances could not. So, for instance, if your name is "Olivia Jones" and your CCA email "ojones2@cca.edu", then try the following login:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Your CCA username, e.g. "<b>ojones2</b>"
            <ul>
                <li>...in which case your CCA password will work</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Your surname followed by a period followed by your given name, e.g. "<b>jones.olivia</b>"
            <ul>
                <li>...in which case your password is your surname, e.g. "Jones", and <strong>you should <a href="mailto:ephetteplace@cca.edu" target="_blank">contact us</a></strong> so we can fix your login</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>If your CCA username is not working, please <a href="mailto:ephetteplace@cca.edu" target="_blank">contact us</a></strong> so we can fix it. Thank you for your patience as we transition to a new library catalog!
